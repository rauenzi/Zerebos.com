            content: "I get asked about this a lot, but the origin of this pseudonym is quite simple. I took the first letter of my real name, <b>Z</b>, and combined it with something I thought was cool. At the time, I was really into Greek mythology, so I went with the god Erebus (also spelled Erebos). But it wasn't originally intended to become my online pseudonym, it was a name for my Skyrim character. Using it as a pseudonym came shortly thereafter because I liked it so much!<br /><br />I also get asked about avatar I use. This was much more recent. During my graduate school work, I took a course on computer graphics and ai. So I built my own ai from scratch and trained it on a specific style of imagery. Once I got the ai to the point I thought was acceptable, I prompted it with just my pseudonym <b>Zerebos</b> and it came up with this. I've been using it ever since, but I really would like to have one made in the same style by a real artist. So if you happen to be an artist&mdash;or know one with this style&mdash;please reach out!"

A lot of my friends have encouraged me to start streaming games because I have funny reactions and commentary. And users from the BetterDiscord world have encouraged me to do development streams. It definitely seems like there's a potential audience, and streaming seems kinda fun. So who knows? Maybe that's in my near future.<br /><br />As for future projects, I don't have anything big cooking at the time of writing. But I'm sure something will come up soon. It usually does when I least expect it."
